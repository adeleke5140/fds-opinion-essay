## Introduction
The goals highlighted by the Fair data protocol are essential in building the future. This future prioritizes data sovereignty, freedom of the individual, and cultivating a fair data economy. That future is necessary. It is essential because the current state of affairs marks data exploitation. 
Investigators uncovered consistent user tracking without the consent of users in the recent scandal of Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. It was scary to see user manipulation on a large scale. But, gladly, the situation is changing for the better.

A recent survey reveals that users are getting concerned. It is related to Apple's new tracking setting in iOS 14.5. According to Statistica, just 21% of iOS users opt into getting tracked. The vast majority do not want to be followed by advertisers. They don't want their every move monitored as they browse the web, especially by Facebook.

This data consciousness is good. Yet it isn't without its challenges. The privacy prompts hurt small businesses that leverage advertising. They cannot afford to carry out user research and instead choose to leverage the reach of megacorps. These megacorps produce apps that millions and billions of users utilize daily.

Therein lies the problem. How can we ensure that web3 and Fair data protocol wants to ensure user sovereignty and provide a fair data economy? No data exploitation or unnecessary tracking but data consent with adequate remuneration for sale of that data.

Reading the Fair Data Protocol(FDP) website illustrates how this would go. The emphasis on Ownership, zero data, control, consensual access, Economic benefit, fair value, social good, Balanced influence, transparency and accountability, Ethics by Design, Openness, and interoperability are admirable visions.

Yet I feel a crucial part of this was left out. Education is necessary to ensure we build a future where privacy is baked into software by design. So that is what I'd be exploring: Data education.

## The Problem: Data Education

People recognize the value of a commodity because they know what it is worth. In our industrialized capitalist society, people want goods. Goods that make them happy and convey a sense of self-worth and accomplishment. Yet, these goods differ in their importance to people. A voracious reader appreciates a new book given by a friend. A musician would be glad to be nominated and win Grammy awards: different strokes, different folks. 

Data privacy is a concern for folks who know the value of their data. Most iOS users are sufficiently informed in the above survey to make the right decision. Yet, only 28.27% of users use an ios device in the global smartphone usage. The rest are on either Android or other operating systems. Data education is not ubiquitous because most users don't know about data. and how data represent their digital twin; as FDP states," YOUR DATA IS YOU."

Our data constitute a digital twin of us. This digital twin develops from our interactions on the world wide web. We must be in charge of how that digital twin is related to, ergo Data sovereignty is a must. Yet, the amount of folks conscious of these facts is not adequate if we are to achieve our dream of a world in which the user is King of their data.

A good illustration is the instant messaging app Whatsapp. Whatsapp is owned and operated by Meta. Facebooks's parent company, yet it is one of the most widely used messaging apps, reaching milestones of 2 billion active users and with more than a 100billion messages sent each day according to WhatsApp 2022 User Statistics: How Many People Use WhatsApp?

At this point, user consciousness regarding data privacy is low. However, surveys like data privacy are a growing concern for more consumers | TechRepublic is remarkable because they show an increasing problem. Yet I fear that it is limiting because the demographic skews towards folks that live in the west. They know what their data is, how it works, and ways it can be exploited by advertisers.

Megacorps provides valuable free services. Yet, it is only accessible to the extent that you can connect with family and friends. You pay for it when corporations sell your data to data brokers; you are monitored 24/7, every move watched, and ads targeted to that Effect. It is not a pretty state of affairs.

## The way forward
We must create a data-conscious world. A data-conscious world would ensure that data privacy solutions don't just cater to a subset of people. Instead, all and sundry accept it as the way the internet should be. 

Fair Data's protocol vision can help in that regard by including Education. Education means explicitly providing resources to inform creators of what they could be losing by having their data exploited. As already stated, data exploitation doesn't just stop at intrusive ads. They are a means to radically alter what we think and act, as exemplified in the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the 2016 US elections. Whether you believe they effectively manipulated voters or not, it is disturbing that a manipulative tactic like that could even take place.

The roadmap is a feasible one and quite encouraging. It is encouraging that people are actively thinking and working on solutions to the current iteration of the web. Yet, we need to ensure that it is an equitable world we are building. Not exclusive by design as older alternatives have been but one that takes along the general population. It is educating and nudging them in the right direction. It's all to create a sovereign data world where the user has the final say.

I would wager that this model of the internet might not precisely be free because the current state works on that model. Yet that is where microtransactions take place. So it is imperative that Blockchain scale. Enough to be used by folks all over the world.

The future is for us to create. We can do it together.
